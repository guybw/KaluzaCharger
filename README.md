# Kaluza Charger
A simple Home Assistant Integration for the Kaluza charged supplied by ChargedEV

# NOTE - I gave up working on this so it doesn't work!

This integration connects to https://cev.kaluza.com which actually connects to https://maestro.vcharge.io

The API was copied from the amazing work posted here: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/d2186c6c2c3554476939
